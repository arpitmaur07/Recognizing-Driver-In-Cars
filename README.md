# Recognizing-Driver-In-Cars
We love the idea of smart cities. The thought of automated smart energy systems, 
electrical grids, one-touch access ports – it’s an enthralling concept! Honestly, it’s a 
dream for a data scientist and I’m delighted that a lot of cities around the world are 
moving towards becoming smarter.
**One of the core components of a smart city is automated recognizing drivers in cars. 
And that got me thinking about it.**
• Think about it - if you can **integrate a driver recognition system into a car, you 
can easily perform many operations and protect the car from being stolen**.
Face recognition is finding its way into the new generations of cars in an attempt to 
increase safety and convenience. From car ignition to theft prevention – there are 
countless possibilities of using facial recognition in cars.
